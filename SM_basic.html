<h1><em>Standard Model of Particle Physics</em></h1>

<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">The standard model is the most successful theory of particle physics that describe the nature at the most fundamental level. SM describe dynamics of three out of four fundamental forces of nature, i.e. strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces. In QFT, quantum mechanics is combined with the classical fields and special relativity, giving rise to quantum fields. The quantum field are considered as the fundamental entity of nature, and the excited quantum of the field is intrepreted as the particle. The particle carry an instrinsic angular momentum, called spin. Based on this basis there are two type of paritlces. Particle with half integer spin are called fermions, and paritcles with integer spin are called bosons.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> The fermions are the basic building block of visible matter. Further the fermions are divided into three generations with increasing mass order. The quarks comes in six flavours which are as follow 
<ol><em>
<li>up(u)</li>
<li>down(d)</li>
<li>charm(c)</li>
<li>strange(s)</li>
<li>top(t)</li>
<li>bottom(b)</li>
</em>
</ol>
The charge of each quark can be 2/3 or -1/3 electric charge. and comes in three flavour Red(R), Green(G), and Blue(B). All quarks carry another inherent quantum number, called <em>baryon number</em>
